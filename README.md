# Many-endpoint-using-SpringDevtools

Here I create many endpoint in my FunRestController.java file.
So Mainly I used many endpoint for the understand the using of Spring DevTools.
 When  I create first end point, and run in the web server(https://localhost:8080):
 
 I see the ouput of the present time of the my pc.
 
 after that, when I change my source code, I need to manually run again  and see the output in the server.
 
 But when I use spring DevTools, I don't need to rerun in manually, instead I save file , It's automatically run.
 
 And I see my all endpoint output in the Crome WebServer.
